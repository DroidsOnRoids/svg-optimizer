# SVG Optimizer Benchmark

This document provides instructions on how to use the `svg_optimizer_benchmark` tool to evaluate the
performance impact of the `svg_optimizer` package on Flutter projects of varying sizes.

## Overview

The benchmark utility is designed to measure the effectiveness of the `svg_optimizer` package by
comparing the size of output files generated by the `flutter build` command, with and without the
optimization package applied. This comparison helps in understanding the impact of SVG optimization
on the overall project size.

## Project Categories

- **Small Project**: Consists of 10 SVG files located in the `assets/benchmark_svg/small_project`
  directory.
- **Medium Project**: Comprises 100 SVG files from the `assets/benchmark_svg/medium_project`
  directory, in addition to the files in the small project category.
- **Big Project**: Includes 400 SVG files from the `assets/benchmark_svg/big_project` directory,
  along with the files from both the small and medium project categories.

## Prerequisites

Before running the benchmark, ensure that:

- The `flutter` command-line tool is installed and accessible in your environment.
- The `svg_optimizer` package is correctly configured in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Running the Benchmark

To execute the benchmark, navigate to the `svg_optimizer/benchmark` directory and run the following
commands based on your target platform:

- **For Android (App Bundle):**
  ```zsh
  dart run svg_optimizer_benchmark.dart --android
  ```
  
- **For iOS (IPA):**
  ```zsh
  dart run svg_optimizer_benchmark.dart --ios
  ```
The benchmark tool will automatically modify the `pubspec.yaml` file to include or exclude
the `svg_optimizer` package, execute the `flutter build` command for each project category, and log
the size of the output files for comparison.

## Example Output
```zsh
*** Benchmarking small project... ***

Building without svg_optimizer...
Building with svg_optimizer...

Small project benchmark result:
Build size without svg_optimizer: 18.98 MB
Build size with svg_optimizer: 18.88 MB
Optimized build size is 102.63 KB smaller (0.53%)

*** Benchmarking medium project... ***

Building without svg_optimizer...
Building with svg_optimizer...

Medium project benchmark result:
Build size without svg_optimizer: 20.55 MB
Build size with svg_optimizer: 19.65 MB
Optimized build size is 915.68 KB smaller (4.35%)

*** Benchmarking big project... ***

Building without svg_optimizer...
Building with svg_optimizer...

Big project benchmark result:
Build size without svg_optimizer: 29.49 MB
Build size with svg_optimizer: 24.00 MB
Optimized build size is 5.49 MB smaller (18.60%)
```
