# SVG Optimizer

A Dart package that optimizes SVG files at build time using SVGO.

## Overview
The goal of this package is to simplify the optimization of SVG files in Flutter projects using transformers.

## Prerequisites
Before package can be used, make sure to complete all of the prerequisites listed below.

1. [Install SVGO](https://svgo.dev/docs/introduction/)
2. Make sure to add Node and SVGO to PATH environmental variable so that SVG Optimizer will be able to run them.

## Usage
### Installation
To use this plugin, add `svg_optimizer` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).

```yml
dev_dependencies:
  svg_optimizer: ^0.0.1
```

or run this command:
```zsh
flutter pub add svg_optimizer 
```

### Example usage
```yml
  assets:
    - path: assets/svg/
      transformers:
        - package: svg_optimizer
```

### Running SVGO with custom configuration
To run `svg_optimizer` with custom SVGO configuration, add a `config` key with path to `svgo.config.mjs` file to the transformer's args in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yml
  assets:
    - path: assets/svg/
      transformers:
        - package: svg_optimizer
          args: ['--config=path/to/svgo.config.mjs']
```

For more information on SVGO configuration and customizing the config, refer to the [SVGO documentation](https://github.com/svg/svgo?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).

### Benchmark
The package includes a benchmark utility to compare the size of the output file generated by `flutter build` with and without the `svg_optimizer`.
To run the benchmark, use the command provided in the `/benchmark` directory documentation.
