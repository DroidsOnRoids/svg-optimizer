# SVG Optimizer

A Dart package that optimizes SVG files at build time using SVGO.

## Overview
The goal of this package is to simplify the optimization of SVG files in Flutter projects using transformers.

## Prerequisites
Before package can be used, make sure to complete all of the prerequisites listed below.

1. [Install SVGO](https://svgo.dev/docs/introduction/)
2. Make sure to add Node and SVGO to PATH environmental variable so that SVG Optimizer will be able to run them.

```yml
  assets:
    - path: assets/svg/
      transformers:
        - package: svg_optimizer

### Benchmark
The package includes a benchmark utility to compare the size of the output file generated by `flutter build` with and without the `svg_optimizer`.
To run the benchmark, use the command provided in the `/benchmark` directory documentation.
